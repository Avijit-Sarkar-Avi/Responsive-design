    <h1>Hepocritas Oath</h1>
    <p>I swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all 
        the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, 
        according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.</p>

    <p>To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner 
        in my livelihood; when he is in need of money to share mine with him; to 
        consider his family as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, 
        if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture; to impart precept, 
        oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, 
        and to indentured pupils who have taken the Healer’s oath, but to nobody else.</p>

        <aside>
            <p>The oldest partial fragments of the oath date to circa AD 275. The oldest extant 
                version dates to roughly the 10th-11th century, held in the Vatican Library. 
                A commonly cited version, dated to 1595, appears in Koine Greek with a Latin 
                translation.[3][4] In this translation, the author translates "πεσσὸν" to 
                the Latin "fœtum."</p>
            </aside>

    <p>I will use those dietary regimens which will benefit my patients according to my 
        greatest ability and judgment, and I will do no harm or injustice to them.
        Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I 
        suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. 
        But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art. I will not use the knife, 
        not even, verily, on sufferers from stone, but I will give place to such as are 
        craftsmen therein.</p>

    <p>Into whatsoever houses I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain 
        from all intentional wrong-doing and harm, especially from abusing the bodies 
        of man or woman, bond or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of 
        my profession, as well as outside my profession in my intercourse with men, if it 
        be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge, holding such things to
        be holy secrets.</p>

    <p>Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever reputation among
         all men for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, 
         may the opposite befall me.</p>

    <h1>Hahnemannian Oath</h1>
    <p>"On my honour I swear that I shall practise the teachings of Homoeopathy, 
        perform my duty, render justice to my patients and help the sick whosoever 
        comes to me for treatment.</p>
    <p>May the teachings of master Hahnemann inspire me and may I have the 
        strength for fulfilment of my mission."</p>

        <h2>Character of Medical Practitioner</h2>
       <p>The primary object of the medical profession is to render service to humanity 
       with full respect for the dignity of man; financial reward is a subordinate 
       consideration. Whosoever chooses this profession assumes the obligation to 
       conduct himself in accordance with its ideals. A practitioner of Homoeopathy 
       shall be an upright man, instructed in the art of healing. He shall keep 
       himself pure in character and be diligent in caring for the sick. 
       He shall be modest, sober, patient and prompt and do his duty without anxiety, 
       and shall be pious and conduct himself with propriety in his profession and in 
       all the actions of his life.</p>

       <article class="first">
       <h2>Standards of Character and Morals</h2>
       <p>The medical profession expects from its members the highest level of 
           character and morals, and every practitioner of Homoeopathy owes to 
           the profession and to the public alike a duty to attain such a level. 
           It shall be incumbent on a practitioner of Homoeopathy to be temperate 
           in all matters, for the practice of medicine requires unremitting 
           exercise of a clear and vigorous mind.</p>
